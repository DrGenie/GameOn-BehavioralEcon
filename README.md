# GameOn: Behavioral Econ Explorations

This repository hosts an interactive site that teaches Behavioral Game Theory through:

- **Ultimatum Game**
- **Trust Game**
- **Public Goods**
- **Speculative Bubbles**
- **Rock-Paper-Scissors**

### Features

1. **Dynamic SVG Diagrams**: No static images; diagrams appear on button click.
2. **Short Quizzes**: Each activity includes a quick question to test understanding.
3. **Countdown Timer**: Available for the Trust Game and Speculative Bubbles to pace each round.
4. **Real-Time Data Collection**: Use Google Forms or Kahoot to log participants' offers, trust amounts, or RPS choices.
5. **Discussion Forums**: Link to GitHub Discussions so students can reflect and ask questions.
6. **Creative Twist**: For the Speculative Bubble, inject “news” or “rumors” mid-simulation to see how quickly students adapt.
7. **Reflection Reports**: Encourage short write-ups on biases and rational thinking after each exercise.
